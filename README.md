### This Work is Incomplete and Will not be Developed Further

This repository holds my work-in-progress notes when I was studying for A-Level exams.
However, I was also self-studying machine learning and AI concurrently and quickly outgrew the material here, making it irrelevant for me.

Using Jupyter Notebook and GitHub for my study notes worked well with these subjects and allowed me to progress faster than when I used traditional methods, I recommend you try it.

These incomplete notebooks are freely available to anyone.

# A-Level Maths using the Jupyter Interactive Notebook

#### Content Originally Based off AQA A-Level Maths and Further Maths

Original AQA specifications can be found from
http://filestore.aqa.org.uk/resources/mathematics/specifications/AQA-7357-SP-2017.PDF
The content in this repository is bound diverge as it evolves the goal is the understanding of a topic in the context of the examination rather than full examination compliance.


## Objectives of This Project

#### 1. To gain experience using a team-based software development platform, Github
  * This will be attractive to employers looking for someone to work well in a team-bases development environment
  * Your Github contributions will show on your résumé

#### 2. To learn to use the coding language python
  * knowing how to use python in the correct manner is a very useful skill
  * knowing how to document and comment any code is essesntial to software development

#### 3. To learn to use a Data Science platform, Jupyter Notebook
  * Jupyter notebook could be very useful for certain projects as it's uses include numerical simulation, visulisations, machine learning and more
  * Jupyter is perfect for careers in data science because it uses languages popular in data science and not just python

#### 4. To Prepare you for your A-Levels
  * The content is based on A-Levels to integrate it with the school syllabus, this will save time in a densely packed school week
